# Applied Econometrics in R

## Overview
This repository contains applied econometrics analyses completed in **R Studio** using **R Markdown**.  
The project focuses on analyzing real economic datasets and translating statistical output into meaningful economic interpretation.

The emphasis is on **reproducible research**, clear documentation, and applied data analysis rather than purely theoretical modeling.

---

## Objectives
- Apply econometric techniques to real-world economic data
- Perform data cleaning and transformation using modern R workflows
- Generate descriptive statistics and conditional summaries
- Communicate results through reproducible R Markdown reports
- Interpret statistical results in an economic context

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **R / RStudio**
- **R Markdown**
- **tidyverse**
- **wooldridge** (applied econometrics datasets)
- Data visualization (base R)

---

## Project Contents
- `R Markdown knitted.html` – Rendered HTML report combining code, output, and written analysis
- R code chunks for data summarization and conditional analysis
- Embedded plots and statistical summaries

---

## Methods Used
- Descriptive statistics
- Conditional means
- Data filtering and aggregation
- Reproducible reporting using R Markdown

---

## Key Takeaways
- Learned how to structure reproducible economic analysis workflows
- Strengthened ability to interpret statistical results beyond raw output
- Gained experience presenting data-driven insights in a clear, readable format

---

## How to View the Analysis
1. Download the HTML file and open it in a web browser  
   **or**
2. Open the R Markdown file in RStudio and click **Knit**

---

## Notes
This project was completed as part of an academic econometrics course and is presented here as a portfolio example of applied data analysis using R.
