This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data(charity)
```

```{r}
charity 
  summarize(avg_gift = mean(gift),
            no_gift = 100 * mean(gift == 0),
            no_gift2 = 100 * mean(respond == 0)) %>%
  round(digits = 2)
gift_info
```

```{r}
mail_summary <- charity %>%
  summarize(min = round(min(mailsyear), digits = 2), # round avg 
            avg = 
round(mean(mailsyear), digits = 2), # round avg 
            max = 
round(max(mailsyear), digits = 2)) # round max 
mail_summary
```
* The average mailings per year in the sample is 'r mail_summary %>% select (avg)
*The minimum number of mailings per year is 'r mail_summary %>% select (min)
*The maximum nmuber of mailings per year is 'r mail_summary %>% select(max)


# Part(iii)

Estimate the model 
$$gift = \beta_0 + \beta_1 mailsyear +u$$


by ols and report the results in the usual way, including the samnple size and R-squared.

```{r results='asis'}
model_iii <- lm(gift ~ mailsyear, data = charity) 

htmlreg(model_iii, 
        stars = c(0.01, 0.05, 0.10),
        caption = "Results for Part (iii)",
        star.symbol = "\\*")
        caption.above = TRUE
```
```{r}
model_iii_hat <- predict 
predict_min <- min(model_iii_hat) %>%
predict_min
```
The smallest predicted charitable contribution in the ample is 2.68 guilders. 

It is not possible to predict gift = 0 with this simple regression. Even with mailsyear = 0 (mailsyear cannot be negative), the smallest gift that could be predicted is 2.01 guilders
