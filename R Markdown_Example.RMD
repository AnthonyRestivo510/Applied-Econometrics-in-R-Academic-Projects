## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. We can get "italics" by using a single asterisks on each  You can embed an R code chunk like this:of the text.
```{r}

```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
we can include an inline R code chunk like this `r average(cars$speed)`.
the coefficient estimate on $\beta_1$ is.  

```{r}
# loanapp data from wooldridge package 
# All observations 

mean(loanapp$price)

loanapp %>%
  summarize(avg_price = mean(price))

# Observations with price less than average price 

mean(loanapp{loanapp$price < mean (loanapp) }$ price)digits=2
loanapp %>% 
  filter (price < mean(price)) %>%
  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) %>%
  round(digits=2)
```
